- Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of spatial heterogeneity in tissues. However, current methods struggle with large-scale, high-resolution data, leading to reduced efficiency and accuracy in detecting spatial domains. A scalable, precise solution is urgently needed.
- Results: We present STAHD, a scalable and efficient framework for spatial domain detection in ST data. Combining a graph attention autoencoder with multilevel k-way graph partitioning, STAHD decomposes large graphs into compact subgraphs and generates low-dimensional embeddings. This improves computational efficiency and clustering accuracy. Benchmarks on human and mouse datasets show STAHD outperforms existing methods and accurately reveals spatially distinct tumor microenvironments and functional regions.
